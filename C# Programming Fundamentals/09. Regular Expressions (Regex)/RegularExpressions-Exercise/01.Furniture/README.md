# Furniture  
  
Create a program to calculate the total cost of different types of furniture. You will be given some lines of input until you receive the line "**Purchase**". For the line to be valid it should be in the following format:  

"**>>{furniture name}<<{price}!{quantity}**"  

The price can be a floating-point number or a whole number. Store the names of the furniture and the total price. At the end print each bought furniture on a separate line in the format:  

"**Bought furniture:  
{1st name}  
{2nd name}  
â€¦**"  

And on the last line print, the following: "**Total money spend: {spend money}**" formatted to the second decimal point.
