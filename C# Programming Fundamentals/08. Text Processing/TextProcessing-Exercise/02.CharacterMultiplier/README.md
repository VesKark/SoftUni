# Character Multiplier
  
Create a **method** that takes **two strings** as arguments and returns the **sum** of their **character codes multiplied** (multiply **str1[0]** with **str2[0]** and add to the total sum).
Then continue with the next two characters. If one of the strings is **longer** than the other, **add the remaining character codes** to the **total sum** without multiplication.
