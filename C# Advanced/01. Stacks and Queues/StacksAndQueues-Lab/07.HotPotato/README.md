# Print Even Numbers
  
Hot potato is a game in which **children form a circle and start passing a hot potato**. The counting starts with the first kid.
**Every n-th toss the child left with the potato leaves the game**. When a kid leaves the game, it passes the potato along to its next neighbor.
This continues until there is **only one kid left**.
