# Symbol in Matrix
  
Create a program that reads **N**, a number representing **rows and cols** of a **matrix**. On the next **N lines**, you will **receive rows** of the matrix.
Each row consists of ASCII characters. After that, you will receive a symbol.
Find the **first occurrence** of that **symbol** in the matrix and print its position in the format: "**({row}, {col})**".
If there is no such symbol, print an error message "**{symbol} does not occur in the matrix**".

## Sample Input and Output  
    
| **Input** | **Output** |  
| :--- | :--- | 
| 3<br> ABC<br> DEF<br> X!@<br> ! | (2, 1) |
| 4<br> asdd<br> xczc<br> qwee<br> qefw<br> 4 | 4 does not occur in the matrix |
