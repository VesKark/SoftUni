# Basic Stack Operations

Play around with a stack. You will be given an integer **N** representing the number of elements to push into the stack,
an integer **S** representing the number of elements to pop from the stack, and finally an integer **X**, an element that you should look for in the stack.
If it's found, print "**true**" on the console.
If it isn't, print the **smallest element** currently present in the stack. If there are **no elements** in the sequence, **print 0** on the console.
 
## Input

- On the first line, you will be given **N**, **S** and **X**, separated by a single space.
- On the next line, you will be given **N** number of integers.

## Output

- On a single line, print either **true** if X is present in the stack, otherwise print the **smallest element** in the stack. If the stack is empty, print **0**.

## Sample Input and Output  
    
| **Input** | **Output** |  
| :--- | :--- | 
| 5 2 13<br> 1 13 45 32 4 | true |
| 4 1 666<br> 420 69 13 666 | 13 |
| 3 3 90<br> 90 90 90 | 0 |
